## Screenshots

### Export Menu (Before)
The export menu showed "coming soon" for PDF and HTML exports:
```
Export Markdown ✅
Export as PDF ⏳ (coming soon)
Export as HTML ⏳ (coming soon)
```

### Export Menu (After)
All export options are now fully functional:
```
Export Markdown ✅
Export as PDF ✅
Export as HTML ✅
```

### Export Features
- **PDF Export**: Generates professional PDFs with proper formatting
- **HTML Export**: Creates styled HTML files with responsive design
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for failed exports
- **File Naming**: Automatic timestamped filenames (e.g., `markdrop-document-2024-01-15.pdf`)

## Technical Implementation

### PDF Export Process
1. Convert blocks to HTML with embedded styles
2. Create temporary DOM element with HTML content
3. Use html2canvas to convert HTML to canvas
4. Generate PDF using jsPDF with multi-page support
5. Download PDF file with timestamped filename

### HTML Export Process
1. Convert blocks to HTML with comprehensive CSS styling
2. Include responsive design and print-friendly styles
3. Generate blob and trigger download
4. Clean up resources

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks for all export functions
- User-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported features

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed
- ✅ PDF export with various content types (text, images, code blocks)
- ✅ HTML export with proper styling and responsiveness
- ✅ Markdown export (existing functionality maintained)
- ✅ Error handling for empty documents
- ✅ File naming with timestamps
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility

### Build Testing
- ✅ `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ All dependencies properly installed

## Additional Notes

### Performance Considerations
- PDF generation uses html2canvas with optimized settings (scale: 2)
- HTML export includes print-friendly CSS for better PDF conversion
- Proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Browser Compatibility
- PDF export works in all modern browsers that support canvas
- HTML export uses standard web APIs (Blob, URL.createObjectURL)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

### Future Enhancements
This implementation provides a solid foundation for future export features:
- Custom export templates
- Batch export functionality
- Additional formats (Word, LaTeX)
- Export to cloud services

### Code Quality
- Follows project's documentation standards
- Comprehensive error handling
- Modular design for easy maintenance
- Type-safe implementation with proper JSDoc comments

This PR significantly enhances Markdrop's export capabilities and resolves a major gap in the project roadmap.
