### **Introduction**

Markdrop is a free, client-side markdown editor that helps you create beautiful GitHub profile READMEs and markdown documents. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data.

### **Data Storage**

Markdrop stores your markdown documents and preferences locally in your browser using localStorage. Your content never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to save it to your account or export it.

* Documents are stored locally in your browser
* Account data (if you sign up) includes email and saved documents
* Theme preferences and editor settings are stored locally

### **What We Collect**

* Email address (if you create an account)
* Markdown documents you choose to save to your account
* Basic usage analytics to improve the editor

### **Security**

We implement standard security measures to protect your data. Your account data (if you create one) is encrypted and stored securely. Since most data is stored locally in your browser, you have full control over it.

### **Third-Party Services**

Markdrop may use third-party services for:

* Authentication (if you create an account)
* Analytics to understand how users interact with the editor
* Hosting and infrastructure

### **Your Rights**

* Access and export your saved documents at any time
* Delete your account and all associated data
* Clear local storage at any time through your browser
* Use Markdrop without creating an account

### **Cookies**

We use minimal cookies to remember your preferences (like theme settings) and maintain your session if you're logged in. You can disable cookies through your browser settings, but some features may not work properly.

### **Updates to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of Markdrop after changes means you accept the updated policy.
